# Freespace Webservice

This is the data service application for [Freespace](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2020-Freespace/Project), which
is deployed here:

https://calvinfreespace.herokuapp.com/

The database is relational and hosted on elephantsql.com. The database user
and password are stored as Heroku configuration variables.
We implement this as a separate repo to simplify Heroku integration.
